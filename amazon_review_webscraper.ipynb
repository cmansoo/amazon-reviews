The phone itself looks fine, there’s a bit of dirt trapped in some small areas of the phone but no scratches or dents. The package it arrived it wasn’t super protected tho, came basically in a thin cardboard box (like the ones iPhones come in when you actually purchase from apple) that was packaged in a bubble envelope, no further wrapping so I can see how people might’ve gotten it banged up when they received it.Overall it’s a fine phone, the price wasn’t super bad but I’d say it seems more like “good” condition vs. “excellent”.Update as of 12/29/2022: I bought this phone originally on 12/15 and the battery health already dropped to 90%. I make sure not to use my phone while it’s charging and to only charge it during optimal charging times like when it gets to 20% or lower, so I’m bummed the battery health already dropped abit.

It fits in hand nicely and only has 90 day warranty..but this is my second refurbished my first had no problems iPhone 7 and still works great. If you buy refurbished use it as much as possible to be sure all works well. Yep a nice phone',\n",
       " \"I can't believe this is a used phone! It's scratch and dent free, everything works as it's supposed to, and even the battery health is in a perfect 100% condition!!However, there are couple minor things I gotta point out:1) The price difference between a brand new 13 mini (from official Apple store) vs. this refurbished unit is only about $50-$60. For a phone at this price point, I don't think many would care to pay a little bit more for a brand new one.  I was lucky to get such a nice clean unit with a perfect battery, but if I have received one with a not so good battery (<90% health), I would definitely return it and get a new phone instead to save the hassle later, as my experience told me a less than 90% battery is pretty much half-dead already and frequent charging is required, guaranteed. Replacing the battery itself will cost you more than $60 for sure, at least before mass-produced aftermarket ones come out.2) The shipment was packed without any hefty insulation. It was shipped with a small USPS priority box and the phone was in the box without much insulation protection. If I shake the box the phone would freely rock up and down, and  I could tell a careless drop or if the postal worker toss around this package the phone would be damaged in no time. Fortunately mine was doing just fine after traveling from IL to TX. Hoped they could at least wrap the phone with a few more layers of bubble wrap of some sort to protect the merchandise.\",\n",
       " 'The only ‘issue’ was an expected possibility.Once phone was ready for use, checked battery life in settings. It was 95% meaning maximum life was 95% of original new battery. 100% would be a new or nearly new phone.

       " 'The phone arrived nicely packed, with a USB cable, wall adapter, and SIM card tool. The phone itself was in perfect condition with no obvious signs that it was a used phone. It did take a surprisingly long time to reach me- about 12 days from when I ordered it.I had trouble when it came to connecting with my carrier (a prepaid T-Mobile MVNO), however. The SIM would activate, but would show as \"Not connected\" and \"Phone not allowed\" in the settings. I spent a week going back and forth with my carrier\\'s customer service and they basically just threw up their hands and insisted the device must be carrier locked, despite it showing as unlocked in the settings, despite it coming up as unlocked/not-blacklisted in online IMEI checkers, despite it being able to connect to both Verizon and AT&T MVNO trial eSIMs. My suspicion is that the IMEI is on some internal blacklist for either my MVNO or T-Mobile in general, but I couldn\\'t get any customer service rep to actually escalate this to someone who could check.I would have kept this phone and switched to another carrier, but my prepaid plan had just been renewed a little over a month ago and I had ~11 months of service that I wouldn\\'t be able to get refunded if I switched. I had been without cell service for the week I was working with them and being without cell service for an additional 12 days while waiting for a replacement from Amazon Renewed wasn\\'t really a viable option for me. So, I ended up ordering a brand new phone from Apple directly. It cost more than a renewed phone, but not as much as I\\'d lose by switching carriers.Bottom line- there was probably an issue with the renewed phone\\'s IMEI from whatever it\\'s previous life was. It wouldn\\'t have been an issue with any other network, and by all rights my carrier SHOULD have been able to identify and fix the issue. Thankfully, the return policy allowed me to return this phone.',\n",
       " 'The renewed packaging and instructions were very nice while not being wasteful. The phone appears to be in excellent condition as expected from the \"premium\" descriptor. The small reduction in battery life is a great value for the discount you get vs buying new.My track record for other \"used\" or \"refurbished\" products has been hit or miss, usually on the \"miss\" side with batteries that are effectively useless, but I would buy this way again for sure.',\n",

My only complaint is that the power brick it came with was on off brand brick and it look cheap and lite weight and that is something I wouldn’t use to charge on my iphone. Honestly, I would never use it, I would just put it on the side.

What am I supposed to do when I need to check my phone in the middle of the night? Turn on a light and wake up my partner? Struggle to type in a passcode? Bad idea.

El reacondicionado excelente dice que golpes o ratones no se distinguen a un brazo de distancia pero si se notan y mucho en especial los de la esquina. Otro de los puntos en contra es que al pasar mis apps y archivos de mi antiguo iPhone me marcaba un error y me hizo restaurarlo 3 veces por lo que decidí iniciarlo como un iPhone nuevo y después descargar Lemus apps y documentos por iCloud. Hasta ahora el celular no ha teñido problemas de red, sistema y batería y con las fundas parecería nuevo así que decidí quedármelo a menos que en lo que resta de garantía me falle.',\n",

It had just a few small scratches on the side but hey, you’ll put a case on it anyways! Setup was easy. It did randomly turn off and wouldn’t turn back on, but we looked up on a website how to reset an iPhone and boom we fixed it. Had to do with pressing the side buttons. It’s been AWSOME ever since.',\n",

There was some minor scratches; very thin which looks like finger nail scratches. But from arm lengths distance, I couldn’t make out where the scratches were and I’m happy with it. My Samsung Galaxy S10e of 2.5 years malfunctioned recently and I needed a new phone but I didn’t want to break the bank.I did a lot of research prior to purchase on which older model was more “bang for your buck.” I found that the iPhone 12 in 2022 was a worthy  purchase considering it has a great camera, pretty display and the potential to see several more years of support from Apple (support being firmware updates which tend to include new features to your phone’s software). Nothing is guaranteed but a lot of people mentioned much older iPhones are still receiving updates. I do have a case on it but I don’t prefer any screen protectors because I want the most out of the display. If I break it, my carrier will fix it for a low cost.From now on, I’m going to buy older models of phones to save money and hope I get a quality phone like this one!',\n",

As for the iphone 12 , it is definitely faster from iphone 11 which I had a hand me down from a family member.

       " \"I declined to leave a unboxing video & picture on this one as its the 2nd device I've bought from this store/seller in a month, technically 3 in total from one of their affiliates. So , I'll start with delivery & packaging , in my profession ( CyberSec/OSINT  ) this is very important detail, it will typically tell the rest of your experience. They did great with shipping times, the got it to me early which is always welcomed and as promised came with a very generic charging block & cable and the device that's about it and it all works great!.  I will also say their after market packaging they used was actually very professional and looked great, sealed with care . There was some paperwork on the side I highly suggest reading as its about your warranty and thus is important.  Remember you pay for what you get, especially with Iphones. I use Android and IOS in business,  I bought a brand new 2021 NEW flagship android device for $320 less than this product but what I paid extra for was that Amazon renewed guarantee which not only promises your device to come with certain prerequisites like over 90% battery life etc BUT it comes with a one year warranty as well as a great return policy which is also a year. I saw alot of mixed reviews , and the details is where you need to look . This company/store did a great job. With its presentation,  Now I'm not going to go to deep I go i to a deep review on the device as a iphone is a iphone,  is a iphone. I have owned every model ,this was a replacement for me aside from business use. This would have been 5 stars all around given the check star system Amazon has in place However,  for example the battery I gave 4 stars, it did come with  90% battery in its bank but like most Iphones unless it's a new battery and has been conditioned ( charged ) properly the battery life is not great on any pro model unless it's the max versions but it will do most great and  as expected. The forest green was a color I loved and was out of stock when I bought it new so that was a nice  addition vs the green iphone 12 pro I have which a total different shade of green. So I bought a bundle , a recommended case and some tempered glass screen protectors,  I will say as they are sufficient,  I made a common mistake as I do like to pay for convienance these bundles are not always the most cost effective route. Do yourself a favor & look around, so  my total was about $730 , the phone itself was priced decent enough but remember that tax is going go be a least $50 added to the device. The phone came 100% Factory Unlocked as advertised and in great shape , the only blemish which I wasn't heartbroken about However for that kind of money and knowing how inexpensive it is to fix the glass as I've done it many of times, there was a decent scratch at the top near the top speaker HOWEVER, I am a tad OCD about things like that especially when spending  that kind of money and having actually bought 3 devices Factory Unlocked I have a high standard. I think most people wont take a 2nd look at it. Just a side note, the resell and value system of used Iphones especially are still very off in 2022 considering for another $150 I could've just bought the iPhone 13 NEW. That said, that has nothing to do with this seller or store just a observation as my business is in all tech. At the end of the day,I can o my fairly go off of what I git & my experience.  I am highly impressed and happy with this purchase. This store/seller took great care in its delivery time, its great packaging, everything came as advertised and product for all Intensive purposes is basically NEW. After 3 devices both IOS & Android , I would not hesitate to do business with this company again. Don't second guess these guys , in reality this was a 5 star sale . They did great business and as I said I was willing to pay more as yes you can find this de ice cheaper all day BUT you are gambling , when it co es to stuff like this I can't stress enough you get what you pay for. The device was perfect, again great presentation,  Factory unlocked,ive tested it on over 20 GSM carriers thus far and I paid for a great product but a peace of mind for a full year , it has a great warranty,  and I have no plans of a return but that option is there if you want it . They did great, I am happy and would buy again!\",\n",

It turned on and I thought we were good to go. The next day, Saturday 12/24/22, it shut off again. It was on within five minutes, so I decided to update the IOS system, in case it was a bug with IOS 16. Now, today, Christmas Day, the phone turned off and would NOT respond to the force restart or charger, for forty-five minutes. I couldn’t contact my family or my Nana who I was trying to visit in the hospital, because my phone would not turn on or do anything at all. There are no visible issues or problems so I’m not sure what is happening. I love this phone so much, I just hope that the seller will reach out regarding this issue!

       " '(12/26/22)The phone I ordered was an iPhone 12 Pro Max FULLY UNLOCKED in Excellent Conditions.Physically, the phone is in the conditions stated. BUT came LOCKED by AT&T with an UNPAID DEBT.I sent a request to AT&T to try to unlock it, but they rejected my request due to the unpaid debt attached to phone (through the IMEI number), making it absolutely USELESS to me.It is unbelievable how the Amazon Renewed Store sells a phone that DOES NOT comply with the standards and conditions that they declare in the product\\'s description.They CLEARLY establish that:\"Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.).\"But this is a total LIE since I can\\'t even use the phone right now due to it being locked.I\\'m awaiting for the seller\\'s response regarding this.UPDATE:(12/28/22)I wrote to the seller on Monday 26th, and they promptly responded with an explanation (a badge of phones were still locked) and a solution (wait 24-72 hrs for the on air unlocking). Safe to say that, just as they said, 24 hrs later the phone was fully unlocked.Changed the rating from 1 star to 4 stars (not going to give 5 due to this issue, but TBH they deserved it). Phone is in PRISTINE conditions, battery health at 90%, no scratches, blemishes, etc. on the phone. First Renewed phone I\\'ve bought and I\\'m happy with it.',\n",
       " \"I recently got an iPhone 12 Pro and it was a little on the small side from me, so I decided to give the Pro Max a try. I thought I'd give Amazon Renewed a try since they have some pretty great deals. I paid $580 before tax for this Sierra Blue 128GB Unlocked model. This was an $1100 phone brand new in 2020, so the price was definitely right.Being a Renewed phone, you're guaranteed a minimum 80% battery health. When I finished setting mine up after it arrived, the battery health showed 86%. The condition of the phone was listed as excellent, and I definitely agree. I can't find a single scratch or blemish on the display. There was a little bit of rubbish inside the alert slider which I was able to get out with a tooth pick. Other than that, this is a great phone. If you go Renewed Premium you're guaranteed a minimum 90% battery health, but I don't think it's worth it. It costs $69 to get the battery replaced on a 12 Pro Max at Apple and you'll have 100% health. I'll just hang onto this one and get the battery replaced in the future.The 12 series iPhones weren't known for their stellar battery life, so don't expect AMAZING battery life. If you want that, you should go with a 13-series iPhone or newer.Everything else, though. Wonderful. Display is gorgeous and gets plenty bright in direct sunlight. It's fast, and will probably get another three to four years of updates as has been the standard for iPhones. Buy with confidence!\",\n",
       " \"I was skeptical about purchasing a refurbished phone from Amazon; I normally go with BestBuy. But I broke my phone right before Thanksgiving and had very limited options -- this one was the best value for what I was looking for.Delivery came exactly on time (5 days with the holiday). The phone was admittedly a little dirty - some fingerprints on the edges, the speaker was dusty - but that was an easy fix. Was it annoying to have to clean it? Yeah, they should come already cleaned (that's why it gets 4 stars) but -- hey, I needed this phone.There are like two barely visible scratches on the screen; you can't even see them from arm's distance (holding your phone at normal length). You can only see them if you're looking for them and they're smaller than a cat hair. I'm totally happy with that.Phone is in great condition, started up fine, everything works. I just popped my SIM card in from my old phone and didn't have a single minute of disrupted phone service; everything transferred over fine. I will say I checked the battery life and it's at 89% which is more than the 80% guaranteed!\",\n",
       " \"I ordered this phone to save money, but also to match the one my spouse has. First, the phone arrived in great packaging, well protected, and no outer blemishes or problems.When beginning the setup process, it continued to get stuck on choosing the country. After several restarts, it would just get stuck on country. So I did some research.  I also contacted the company at this time. Ultimately I learned online that I needed to connect it to my laptop, upgrade the software, then do the setup.  That time it completed setup (after several attempts).  However, now the phone was in SOS mode.  I didn't think much of it because I did not have the sim in at that time.  This complete process took about 2 hours.After I put in the sim and started the phone, the network still said SOS. More research. Still no call from the company.  About 6 hours later, 4 attempts at factory reset to start over, and chatting with my cell carrier, I gave up with the phone still in SOS mode.  It was still updating all my apps though, so I let this happen throughout the night.The next morning I called my carrier again and they worked me through a few more things. Ultimately they had to do a reset on the sim because something in the phone was triggered as being hacked so it shut off the sim as well.  I'm not sure how this really happens, but this is what was told to me in layman's terms.Thankfully after another hour in the morning, my carrier was able to get the SOS mode off and reset.  It is now working well and continuing life as usual, with an updated phone.So, buyer beware. If you're buying a phone online to save money, make sure it has some kind of return policy. This one did, and we were originally told by our carrier that we may have to return the phone. I'm glad we pushed through the problem, because I hate doing that.  However, just be prepared for some kind of issues to pop up. We would have had to pay the Apple Store or somebody else to fix it IF it didn't have a return possible.Ultimately this phone ended up being ok. The looks are fantastic; no scratches or blemishes. We are not sure on battery life yet, and I will update this review IF I see the battery life is diminished. Otherwise, besides the problems we had in the beginning, the phone has been overall good and now functioning well.\",\n",

It still has a slight smell but at least it's been cleaned.What was Missing was the SIM removal tool!Luckily, I had a spare SIM removal tool available.Had to restore and reset the iPhone twice before the clean iOS took effect.It originally included iOS 15.6 which I was hoping to keep and try to update to 15.7.1 but Apple stopped that update and is now forcing newer devices to update to iOS 16.x, currently 16.2!After that, used iTunes for Windows to copy over all the media files to the 13 PM since the restore/reset function literally wipes the iPhone clean.Finally, got lucky and found a Speck clear case on clearance along with a glass screen protector, both at discounted prices, at a nearby Walmart! ;)Currently it's working fine.May update the review if anything else changes.\",\n",
       " \"Like all, I was skeptical about the experience of buying a used phone on Amazon. I have to say that the horror turned into excitement when the phone booted up, transfered all info, and worked flawlessly. The battery life was close to 100%. There wasn't a ding on the phone. I would recommend getting an 'Excellent Condition' phone to have a  similar experience. As far as cost goes, I think the price was fair as it was last years top model but a new 13 pro max would have been $1099 most likely, and I paid just over eight hundred for this one. Face recognition alwas seemless. Right when you lift the phone to your face it immediately unlocks. I elected next day shipping for $12 more, and it showed up the next day. I am very happy with my experience and I hope this helps some of you out there make a decision.\",\n",
       " 'The iPhone 13 ProMax arrived at the time it was giving. The phone is in excellent condition no physical damage and the battery life whenArrive was at 85 percent. I ‘m satisfied with my purchase at the beginning I had my doubts for purchasing a phone online . For a refurbished iPhone is worth the price I recommended.',\n",
       " 'Excellent phone , as a used phone we must watch for the battery life : it must be 100% because when the battery reach 80% you must replace the battery so with 100% battery life you have 20% range before replacing the battery .so don’t buy used phone with less than 100 % battery life.',\n",

Of course there’s unique features with this IPhone I very much appreciate. The battery life is great so far and I love that I can see the battery percentage of my Bluetooth ear buds. However, I’m VERY disappointed with the charger this phone comes with. 1 week of use and the charger was already refusing to charge my phone. Had mornings where my phone didn’t charge at all overnight and it was frustrating having to go to work with low battery. I had no choice but to buy my own separate lightning charger which works completely fine after 1 month of use. Overall good phone and works like new.',\n",
       " 'Just like the title says, yeah, it’s a bit overrated. It’s a great phone, very user friendly, and it is fairly decent in size, optimization, and compatibility. However, I don’t like that the camera system isn’t as user friendly as the phone itself is, and I don’t like how complicated the process is to use GIfs, share data between iPad and iPhone, and how overrated overall it is. It’s not worth the money, I personally don’t think it’s worth the hype, but for the use, it does it’s job. I’m still new to it, I’ve only had it for a day, so I’ll come back in a month or so with an update and more thoughts.',\n",

It was a little bit dirty (this thing is a fingerprint magnet so I don’t blame them), I don’t see any scratches or dings. The overall battery health was 100% which is awesome, for $890 this was a great deal. I bought this phone as an xmas gift and I haven’t activated it yet so hopefully that will work out as well. Overall, I love it so far, I’m gonna clean it and put it back in the box and wrap it for xmas! 🎅',\n",

After reading the reviews on this one, I took a chance…I can’t tell you how glad that I am for taking that chance. He’s had it for just about 2 months and it works perfectly. I think the battery life was like 98% when we got it. I found a light scratch on the back, which is covered by the case, so it didn’t matter. That is ALL that I could find wrong! I couldn’t believe that it looked brand new when I opened it and setup was easy and smooth. Really, take a chance on this one! Oh, I also emailed to ask a question and they got right back to me. It’s the real deal!',\n",

Didn’t use the face recognition or the finger print.  Like it with just the 4 digit pass code.  The battery life will have to wait to see. That is all that was wrong with my last phone, the battery was starting to not hold a charge after 7 years of use.  Only reason I ordered a new one.',\n",

The price was fair what made the price even better was that I traded in 2 older iPhones ( xs max and an iPhone 8 credit total of $268 ) for some Amazon trade in monies. There was a two week of “using old junk phone, a 7 that has been put through the ringer but still works. This 12 mini has no scratches, touch screen is the best I’ve ever had. The one feature I missed the most. True Tone. It’s back and I’m never changing another battery again. Apple does it for &$69 the only down fall, if you want to call it one is the battery life is at %84 I’m more than happy to hand over $69 plus tax to apple for a new battery. It also came with a new cord and charging block. I also like to see mi-fi sticker on both. Gave me peace of mind at see those tags. I will always look to Amazon renewed apple products in the future.

I transferred my SIM card over to the new phone and used my MacBook to transfer all my data/contacts/apps…took less than 5 mins and another 10 mins logging back into apps to approve face recognition…my favorite feature!!! After that…it was ready to go!Face recognition is quick, browser tabs open and process quickly, and the battery life is long-lasting and dependable. Aside from functionality, the appearance is beautiful; clean lines, no chips or dents, and the Pacific Blue is an awesome color. The screen is so clear and vibrant…I was impressed with how detailed everything looks compared to the IPhone X. I could have upgraded to the ‘13 or ‘14 but went with the ‘12 because I’m wasn’t looking for a ton of features besides calling, texting, web browsing, taking some photos, watching a video here or there, and running a few apps. If you’re like me…the 12 Pro is a good choice for the money.The 12 vs 12 Pro: if you want to take better pics…go with the Pro, but if you don’t really care about photo quality…the regular IPhone 12 might be you better and cheaper choice.That said, I’m impressed the most with the night shooting…above par compared to what I’ve used in the past…worth the upgrade to the Pro for me.Overall…extremely happy with my purchase!',\n",

The ability to customize something as basic as the keyboard (to the effective degree you can in android) is frustratingly absent, and you are stuck with the most basic of keyboards that require you to have to flip through different keyboard screens just to get to common things like a questionmark.Phone specific, the cameras and what not are good, but the screen colors are a tad washed out/pale, and there really isn't a fix for it.All and all, my next phone won't be an iphone, apple IOS is just too archaic and undeveloped compared to android, but the phone is decent enough that I'll hang on to it for a year or so before upgrading, which is something I don't usually do, given my last phone was a Note 9 that I used for 4 years.  Wanting to upgrade after a year is what happens when apple's flagship phone is crippled by a severely lacking operating system...\",\n",

It could have just been an oversight so I’ll give it a go.Original: This was advertised as excellent condition and probably should have been categorized as good condition. The screen and back glass are both scratched and dinged up so much that it glitters in the light.The shipping was super fast, it came packaged well, and the price was decent. It seems to work perfectly otherwise, but dings in the screen can definitely affect the overall strength and make it less durable. This is for my 15 year old son so durability is a must.I sent a message to the seller yesterday but haven’t heard back yet. It hasn’t been 48 hours for a response, not faulting them for that, but I may just return it. It seems either they didn’t review it well before re-selling it, or they didn’t think the damaged glass was a quality issue.

Battery condition said it was still at 100% so that was really nice. All and all very satisfied with the seller.Now to the review of the phone itself.This is a fantastic phone in every way. I’ve bought budget phones for 10 years now because I couldn’t afford the best money could buy. The last iPhone I had was the iPhone 5. This happened to be within my budget and I couldn’t be happier with the phone itself. I was coming from a pixel 4a so a slight downsize from a 5.7 in screen to a 5.4 wasn’t an issue at all. I truly enjoy a smaller phone as I have small hands and find large heavy phones annoying. To have basically a flagship phone but in smaller packaging has been great. Battery life is actually a lot better than expected and Lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. If your hesitant to get this phone, don’t be! I will update the review if anything changes but so far I’m absolutely in love with my new phone.',\n",

The charging block and cable quickly failed after only a couple of uses and I had to go buy a new charging cable and a new charging block the phone is charging fine now.

The speaker and microphone grills were completely clean and shiny, the battery health is at 100%, and it came with a screen protector already installed with no air bubbles!

       " \"Like some of the other reviewers, I had concern about the condition of a 'renewed' phone. As it turned out, it arrived in perfect, like-new condition. No observable defects, no observable wear/scratches/scuffs even when looking closely, not at arms length as Amazon mentions.Using the iOS battery health app, the battery health was at 100% when I received it. Amazon advertises that the phone will arrive with at least 80% battery health. To check, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health and then look at Maximum Capacity. If it shows up in problematic condition, Amazon covers it with a generous 90 day return policy. I suspect that the one I received was an 'instant regret' purchase by the original owner and returned immediately. It seems likely that most 'renewed' phones will have some battery degradation so expecting battery health to be at 100% is unrealistic.The only issue I had was not related to this phone. Call sound quality wasn't good and drop outs. After doing a network reset, that was fixed. Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset Network Settings > enter your passcode and then Reset Network Settings (red letters). Your phone will reboot. You'll have to log on to your wifi network again and if you have a VPN, you may have to set that up again. After doing this, no drop outs and good sound quality. Note that the network reset process changed after the iOS 15 update. Going forward, the sequence above may change again.Amazon's refurb department did a great job of cleaning, wiping the previous installation of iOS and repackaging it. Regardless, I did a complete reset before restoring from a backup. This probably isn't necessary but it brought some peace of mind knowing that It was a clean installation of iOS.It arrived in a well designed aftermarket box designed for cell phones, an Apple charger, Apple cable and an aftermarket screen protector of the type used for shipping protection. They mention that it may come with an aftermarket charger and cable so don't expect Apple branded accessories.Presumably most people purchasing the iPhone 12 Mini will have informed themselves of the pros and cons of this model (ahem..battery life). I'd guess that most will not find battery life to be an issue. For heavy users and for those that regularly use high drain features such as GPS navigation, it would be advisable to have charging capability in the car and at work.The only thing I'd add is that if you want the leather MagSafe case from Apple, keep an eye on prices. It usually sells for 60 dollars but the black one was on sale in Amazon at the time of this writing for 23.99 + tax. Instant purchase and on the way.I used an Apple leather case with an iPhone 8. I was satisfied with its basic protection, feel and handling. Its unlikely to provide as much drop protection as an Incipio Duo and other cases designed with drop protection in mind but 23.99 + tax was hard to pass up.Happy customer, solid purchase for an unlocked iPhone.\",\n",

That makes me very nervous.-There were some dings I found on the outer edge of the phone in 4 places-No biggie as there\\'s a cover on it now.-Wish there was an option for T-mobile vs. Unlocked. Apparently, there are multiple sellers on this product and even though I chose \"T-mobile\" I received \"Unlocked\" which is fine, but I paid more for the T-mobile vs. another seller that was a cheaper \"Unlocked\" option.Other than that I\\'d rate this purchase 4-4.5.

It feels better in my hand with a case and I added a glass screen protector.CHECKLIST: Proximity sensor while on a call, open up a white board website and make sure the whole screen functions correctly by coloring every inch, ear speaker and bottom speaker, mic, connectivity to your phone service and to your wireless, silent/sound rocker on the left side halfway up, make sure all the buttons press in cleanly and make sure there, check the flash by using flashlight or taking photos and be sure to shine a light on the camera lenses to make sure there are no scratches. Front facing and the two back cameras ....Overall great purchase.',\n",

(First off, let me just say that I wouldn’t buy or trust one that isn’t excellent condition, personally. It feels too risky for the price. But this is up to you!) I’ve had this phone for a little over a week now. I made the video right after I got it to try to showcase it the best I could. Besides the tiny scratch on the front that is barely noticeable, the phone arrived in pristine condition. It works smoothly, fast, and beautifully. As a new phone would! It has 95% battery health. I upgraded from an iPhone SE 2 to this 12 and honestly, just wow. It’s my first actual iPhone that isn’t an SE (I had both first and second generations of the SE.) So this was a great experience in several ways! It’s refurbished, but works/looks so perfect, just like a new phone. I am just so impressed and happy.

The battery capacity was 88% out of the box (meaning 88% of the battery was functional and at full-charge (a reading of 100% after charging) meant it\\'s full capacity of 88% was reached). I bought this refurbished so I was not expecting a full-capacity battery load. With that said:* I downloaded @ 8 of my favorite apps and removed/closed down a number that came with the phone that I would never use* Leaving the phone on without any frequent use, the battery charge lasted 3-4 days (@ 72-96 hours). I have not put it to the test of typical use phone/web/streaming use yet* The set-up was uncharacteristically simple and without a glitch - very surprising and greatly appreciated* Facial recognition has been perfect so far* My other phones have been large in size - but I thought I would try this \"mini.\" Again, to my surprise - I really like it. I can hold and operate the keyboard with one hand - and small hand at that. It is very lightweight and easily fits into a pants pocket.So far, so good - very pleased.',\n",

I don’t have time to return it as I’m giving it to someone tomorrow, but I had to spend 40 minutes trying to get all the grease and dirt out of every nook and cranny. Disgusting. In general I have been happy with renewed items on Amazon but I don’t think I’ll risk ordering again.',\n",
